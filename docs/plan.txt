Title: Lens Identification and Modeling in Multi-Epoch Imaging Data

Questions:
* What do known lensed quasars look like when observed with PS1?
* By fitting all pixels in all available exposures simultaneously, can we:
  * Answer the question, is this a lens or not?
  * Measure the lightcurves of the blended objects?
  * Measure the lens galaxy?
  * Measure the model components' positions to better than the co-added image
     PSF width/(S/N)? Better than the best exposure?

Abstract:



Method:

We perform a principled comparison between 2 models:

 "lens" : 1 quasar multiply-imaged by a simple lens galaxy with extended
          optical emission. Galaxy is an LRG.

 "nebula" : K "stars" and one "galaxy".
 
In both models and in each filter, a point source k is assumed to have fluxes
at each epoch drawn iid from a Gaussian with mean f0_k and variance sigf_k^2,
while a galaxy is assumed to have an elliptically-symmetric Gaussian constant
brightness distribution.

Priors:
  Component positions ~ N(object {ra,dec}, object width}

  Galaxies:
  - Gaussian shape prior from ellipticity distribution, width 0.25 in e1, e2
  - i-band flux prior from LRG population counts (lens) or all galaxies
     population counts (nebula)
  - size priors from populations too - covariance with fluxes.   
  - color priors from LRG population colours (lens) or all galaxies colors
     (nebula). Build KDE from survey data to same depth. Do in CFHT
     photometric redshift and magnitude slices. 
     Need to get these, and worry a little bit about filter conversions.
  - galaxy mass (sigma_SIS) from FP, or at least Faber-Jackson relation. 
     Include luminosity evolution, and evolution of normalisation: needs
     redshift. Empirical prior? Need flux-limited sample with i-band mag and
     velocity dispersion, extending to z=1. Use FJ relation with scatter to
     assign velocity dispersion to all CFHT LRGs, check that resulting
     velocity function agrees with fits to SDSS. 

  Point sources:
  - Quasar i-band flux prior from number counts; 
     variance prior dependent on flux? Colour prior from number counts, 
     variance prior dependent on colour? Stripe 82 quasars. Kelly catalog?
     Stripe 82 data straight. KDE of colours/ counts.
  - Star i-band flux prior from number counts; variance from number counts.
      Colour prior from number counts, variance prior dependent on colour.
      Star prior must include quasar prior. All "stars" (small objects)
      in CFHT, these need to include plenty of faint blue galaxies, to
      represent SF regions of nebulae. Magnitude slices? 
  
Non-linear fit: MCMC. Priors must not be too spiked. Probably not a problem.

PSF assumed available, as postcard image. Whole scene realised and compared
with observed image. Fit to all images simultaneously.


Data needed:

- CFHT photo-z catalog: g,r,i,z,Reff,epsilon,[zphot]
    - select LRGs, make KDE of Pr(g,r,i,z,Reff,epsilon,zphot|LRG)
- Evolving LRG FJ relation with scatter, to make Pr(sigma|i,zphot)

Paper II

Questions:
* Can the lens or not model comparison of Paper I be done in catalog space?
* How is the lensed image position precision different?
* How are the recovered lightcurves different?

Requires: Gcat paper from NIPS/SPIE
